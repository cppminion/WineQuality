NTU SC1015
This is the miniproject submission for mod SC1015. We are group 9 in the Lab Group SC2.

To run the project please install the following python libraries:

3. 

The dataset that we have used is: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
You can also find this in the data folder of the github repo. For this project, we have performed the data analysis on the red wine.

In the "src" folder you will find:
1. The jupyter notebook where we have performed the data cleanup such as dropping null values, dropping duplicated rows, reclassifying for machine learning, removing outliers, and feature scaling.
2. Jupyter Notebook where we have done the EDA which included histogram, boxplot for the reclassified and the raw data, stripplot, trying to find correlation between the variables, and performing the Point Biserral Correlation to find error in the correlation.
3. In the machine learning notebook we have built a descision tree, performed Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine to train our model.
4. The loss history image _______
